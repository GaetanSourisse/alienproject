"Alien Project"
During two weeks, we had to create a retro video-game with the software Pico-8 and the language LUA. It was our first Ada Tech School project, 3 weeks after the start of our training school. So there are a lot of things to improve (cleaning and factoring code especially)!

There were 3 of us working on this project, I mainly took care of the collision and rebound functions. 
It's not perfect but we were proud to present this project.
